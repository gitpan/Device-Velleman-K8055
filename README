Device-Velleman-K8055

Currently this module is just a Win32::API wrapper around the K8055D.dll that Velleman
supplies with the board. Since that will only work on Win32 systems, I intend
to write something myself that will be portable to other platforms...patches for
this are welcome.

You need to copy this DLL in a directory in your path (e.g. C:\\WINDOWS)
The DLL can be found inside this package.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you indeed choose to run 'make test', please keep an eye on your screen to see what
tests are run. One of the tests requires you to press the buttons on the K8055 board.
