Device-Velleman-K8055

The Velleman K8055 interface board has 5 digital input channels and 8 digital output channels.
In addition, there are two analogue inputs, two analogue voltage outputs and two PWM
(Pulse Width Modulation) outputs with 8 bit resolution. The number of inputs/outputs can be
further expanded by connecting more (up to a maximum of four) cards to the PC's USB connectors.

Currently this module is just a Win32::API wrapper around the K8055D.dll that Velleman
supplies with the board. Since that will only work on Win32 systems, I intend
to write something myself that will be portable to other platforms...patches for
this are welcome.

You need to copy K8055D.dll in a directory in your path (e.g. C:\\WINDOWS)
The DLL can be found inside this package.

INSTALLATION

First of all, make sure you have connected the K8055 device to one of your PC's USB
ports. You also need to set the device number. The tests supplied with this module
assume that you have set your device number to 0. This is the default setting on the
board.
You can change this setting by modifying the jumpers SK5 and SK6 according to this table:

SK5   SK6    CARD ADDRESS
ON    ON     0
OFF   ON     1
ON    OFF    2
OFF   OFF    3

Note: These settings must be done before the USB cable is connected to the K8055 card or before
turning the PC on.

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    nmake
    nmake test
    nmake install

If you indeed choose to run 'make test', please keep an eye on your screen to see what
tests are run. One of the tests requires you to press the buttons on the K8055 board.
